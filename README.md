# Algorand Sample Project

This is a **sample Algorand project** created for Assignment 1.
It contains a minimal Python script that demonstrates using the Algorand SDK
to create an account object (no network calls) and print the address.

**What to do**:
1. Replace `your-username` in the repository URL with your GitHub username.
2. Add real development work (contracts, dApps, tooling) instead of the sample script.
3. Push this repository to GitHub (create as a new repository, *not* a fork).
4. Create a Pull Request into `electric-capital/crypto-ecosystems` adding the TOML entry.

Files included:
- `algorand_demo.py` — example script
- `requirements.txt` — sample dependency list
